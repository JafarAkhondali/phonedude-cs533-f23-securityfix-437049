## Assignment 7
## CS 533: Web Security

Assignment 7 is focused on demonstrating and exploring issues related to phishing.
To that end, I created a README.md report for this assignment containing links to the code, a short discussion of any issues I encountered making the site "display" correctly from my server (if any), screen shots of the site rendered in my browser, the log file of harvested user names and passwords, and a Youtube video of my site in operation.

A Youtube video of my site in operation:

The files are saved in the Arcand\7 folder.

README.md is a well-organized and informative report for this assignment in the directory 7\ containing links to the code, a short discussion of any issues I encountered making the site "display" correctly from my server (if any), screen shots of the site rendered in my browser, the log file of harvested user names and passwords, and a Youtube video of my site in operation.

log.txt is a text file and log file in the directory 7\ of all login information sent to my local node server when the login button is pushed.

server.js is a javascript file in the directory 7\ that was used to start the server and serves one of my 100 web sites that offers logging in from the previous assignments from my own node server on my machine to create a convincing phishing site.

script.js is a javascript file in the directory 7\public\ that is used to help send the login information to my local node server and record it in a log file.

index.html is a html file in the directory 7\public\ that helps demonstrate and explore issues related to phishing.

style.css is a css file in the directory 7\public\ that helps style index.html.
