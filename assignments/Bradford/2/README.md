# CS 533 Assignment 2  

In this assignment, I set up an HTTP server utilizing the express package in node.js. It is run by executing the following command:
```
node server.js
```
## Directory contents
The server.js file is a JavaScript file that runs the HTTP server with express. It is set up to serve the included html files at appropriate paths.  
The server also serves a favicon.ico file (an ODU emblem).
