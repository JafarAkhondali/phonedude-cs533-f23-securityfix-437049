Assignment 2 README File

I have created my local server using node js. I imported express and cookie-parser. After creating my index.js file that stores my 3 paths on localhost:4000. I then created my HTML pages, to visualize what my code would look like before I added it into my js file. I will be showing 2 HTML demonstrations for this assignment.
