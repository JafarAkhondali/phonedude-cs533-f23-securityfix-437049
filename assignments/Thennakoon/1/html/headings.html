         <h1>Importance of sports to health and fitness</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Playing sports is a great way to improve one’s health and fitness. Sports have a huge impact on a person’s daily life and health. Sometimes it’s difficult to muster the motivation to spend hours on a treadmill to lose stubborn fat. Still, an invitation to participate in an exciting sport would motivate you to get moving.</p>

        <h2>Playing Sports Makes You Happier</h2>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Life is difficult, and positive and negative emotions are constantly around us. Many people cope with difficult situations by binge-watching television, overeating, or working on themselves.</p>

        <h3>What should we do</h3>
        <p>If you want to trigger positive feelings, playing sports is the best option as it stimulates the production of endorphins and reduces your perception of pain. </p>

        <p>The obesity epidemic affects millions of people worldwide, and our current way of life is to blame. We spend 9 to 10 hours a day in a cubicle at work, then return home worn out to eat whatever is on the table. This routine increases your chances of gaining weight and thus leads to hypertension and heart disease.</p>
