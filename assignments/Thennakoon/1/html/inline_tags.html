        Everything is made of <strong>atoms</strong>. An atom is the smallest particle of an element, like oxygen or hydrogen. Atoms join together to form molecules. A water molecule has three atoms: two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. That's why water is sometimes referred to as H2O. A single drop of water contains billions of water molecules.

        Water as a gasâ€”vapor is always present in the air around us. <span>You cannot see it</span>. When you boil water, the water changes from a liquid to a gas or water vapor.
