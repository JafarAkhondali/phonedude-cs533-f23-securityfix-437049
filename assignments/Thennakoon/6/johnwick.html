        <h1>John Wick</h1>
        <p>This film is my favourite because of its action scenes.
        It has a good storyline which kept me attracted to it. 
        The main actor Keanu was the perfect choice for the role of John Wick, 
        and he brings a quiet intensity to the character that's impossible to ignore.</p>
